///
/// Privacy invariants (enforced here, not by the caller):
///
/// - Nothing is sent while the toggle is off. When the desktop app's own state
///   file exists, its decision and its install id are used and this app never
///   writes that file: one decision covers both, and the two apps' events join
///   on one id. Standalone, the decision lives in this app's own defaults and
///   defaults off for EU / EEA / UK / CH and for an unknown region.
/// - The only identifier is a random id minted locally. Switching the toggle
///   off mints a fresh one so past and future data cannot be linked.
/// - Events carry a day-granularity date only, and every prop goes through the
///   whitelist sanitizer below. No paths, no session content, no exact amounts.
/// - Debug builds and `swift run` never send (`CODEBURN_TELEMETRY_DEV=1`
///   overrides, for end-to-end testing).
