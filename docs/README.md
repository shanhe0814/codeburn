- [optimize.md](optimize.md) — `codeburn optimize` scans your Claude Code sessions and your `~/.claude/` setup, reports what is costing tokens without earning them, and grades the setup A to F.
- [plans-and-quota.md](plans-and-quota.md) — Subscription plan tracking and live provider quota via `codeburn quota`.
- [vscode.md](vscode.md) — The VS Code extension: how it reuses the CLI client and the desktop renderer, which Node it runs on, workspace scope, and how to build and test it.

- [design/perf-cache-fix.md](design/perf-cache-fix.md) — `codeburn status --format menubar-json` was measured taking 25-90+ seconds per call, with no speedup on a repeat call against an unchanged, freshly-warmed cache.
