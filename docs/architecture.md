# CodeBurn Architecture

A map of the codebase. Read this once before opening a non-trivial PR.

## Three Surfaces

CodeBurn is one Node.js CLI plus three ambient GUI clients that shell out to it.

```

The macOS menubar (`mac/`), the Windows tray app (`windows/`), and the GNOME extension (`gnome/`) all invoke `codeburn status --format menubar-json --period <p>` and parse the JSON. They do not share code with the CLI; they only depend on its output contract.

## CLI (`src/`)

`src/cli.ts` is the Commander.js entry point. The bin field in `package.json` points at `dist/cli.js`. Twelve commands are registered:

| Command | Line | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `report` | 274 | Default. Interactive Ink TUI dashboard. |
| `status` | 358 | Compact text status, plus `--format menubar-json` for clients. |
| `today` | 524 | Today-only view of `report`. |
| `month` | 542 | Month-only view of `report`. |
| `export` | 560 | CSV or JSON dump of usage data. |
| `menubar` | 621 | Downloads and launches the macOS menubar bundle. |
| `currency` | 636 | Sets display currency. |
| `model-alias` | 687 | Maps an unknown model name to a known one for pricing. |
| `plan` | 737 | Configures a subscription plan for overage tracking. |
| `optimize` | 857 | Runs all 14 waste detectors. |
| `compare` | 870 | Compares two models side by side. |
| `yield` | 882 | Tracks which sessions shipped to main vs. were reverted (experimental). |

### Pipeline

```
provider.discoverSessions()
        |
        v
provider.createSessionParser(source, seenKeys)
        |
        v   yields ParsedProviderCall (see src/providers/types.ts)
        |
        v
src/parser.ts: parseAllSessions()
        |
        v   aggregates into ProjectSummary[]
        |
        v
src/daily-cache.ts: aggregate per day, persist
        |
        v
output formatter (Ink TUI, JSON, or menubar-json)
```

`src/parser.ts` is the central aggregator. Public exports: `parseAllSessions`, `filterProjectsByName`, `extractMcpInventory`. It owns the dedup `Set` (`seenKeys`) that is passed into every provider parser so a turn that surfaces in two providers (Claude logs vs. Cursor mirror, for instance) is counted once.

### Parallel Cold Parse

A cold parse spends most of its time on work that is per-file and pure: reading a
session JSONL or a Codex rollout, decoding it, and turning each line into a
journal entry. `src/parse-workers.ts` moves that onto `worker_threads` when the
pending workload is big enough to pay for them. Each worker runs the same
per-file function the serial path runs — `parseClaudeFileFull` for a Claude
session, `parseCodexFileFull` for a Codex rollout — against an empty dedup set,
and ships the result back as a JSON string together with every dedup key it
claimed. The parent installs results in the same order the serial loop would, and
everything with cross-file state (the dedup sets, canonical project paths, spawn
links, PR correlation, the Codex result cache) stays on the main thread. A file
whose keys were already claimed by an earlier file, or whose worker failed, is
re-parsed in-process — so the output is identical to the serial path either way.
That overlap check is what makes a forked Codex rollout safe: it replays its
parent's `token_count` and `token_usage_record` history under the parent's key
namespace, collides, and is re-parsed against the real dedup set.

A Codex worker never touches `src/codex-cache.ts`: it returns the cache entry it
would have written and the parent writes it, in install order, so
`flushCodexCache` publishes exactly what a serial parse would. Only whole-file
parses go off-thread; the append/incremental paths (a Claude append, a Codex
byte-offset resume) are untouched and stay in-process. The decision is made per
provider — the Claude scan and the provider loop run one after the other, so at
most one pool is alive — and the pool is terminated when its scan ends, so the
resident `serve` child never accumulates threads.

The pool is off by default for anything that is not a large cold parse:

| Gate | Serial when |
|---|---|
| Pending bytes | under 200 MB behind the pending whole-file parses |
| Cores | `availableParallelism() <= 2` |
| Memory | under 4 GB available |

Otherwise the worker count is
`min(cores - 1, min(0.25 * available, 2 GB) / perWorker, max(pendingFiles / 50, pendingBytes / 200 MB))`.
Files and bytes each earn threads on their own, so a few hundred multi-hundred-MB
Codex rollouts parallelize as well as a few thousand small Claude transcripts. The
gate is bytes only, deliberately: 250 pending files holding under a megabyte
between them spawn threads that make the run ~5% slower, and a file count only
starts paying for itself around 400.

`perWorker` is the per-thread memory budget, derived per parse as
`clamp(256 MB, 2 x (pendingBytes / pendingFiles) + 128 MB, 1 GB)`. A flat figure
was wrong in both directions: small Claude transcripts peak well under 256 MB,
while a 260 MB Codex rollout peaks near 430 MB in its worker and scales linearly
with the pool. The budget also covers the parent, which buffers up to `pool.size`
finished results while it installs one.

"Available" is `process.availableMemory()`, falling back to `os.totalmem()`. It is
deliberately not `os.freemem()`: on macOS that counts free pages rather than
available memory and reads as a few hundred MB on an idle 128 GB machine, so a
gate built on it switches the feature on and off between runs. On Linux outside a
memory-limited cgroup, `availableMemory()` reports free memory and can still
under-report on a busy host — which fails safe, to fewer threads or none.

`CODEBURN_PARSE_WORKERS` overrides the decision and skips every gate above:
`0` forces the serial parse, `N` forces N workers (capped at the core count).
`CODEBURN_VERBOSE=1` prints the resolved worker count and the reason for it.

### Cache Layers

Three caches under `~/.cache/codeburn/` (override with `CODEBURN_CACHE_DIR`):

| File | Owner | Invalidation |
|---|---|---|
| `codex-results.v<n>.json` | `src/codex-cache.ts` | `mtimeMs + sizeBytes` per Codex `.jsonl`. Unsuffixed `codex-results.json` is adopted when versions match and never overwritten. |
| `cursor-results.v<n>.json` | `src/cursor-cache.ts` | Resolved database path plus combined modification time and size of the Cursor SQLite db and its WAL, when present. Unsuffixed `cursor-results.json` is adopted when versions match and never overwritten. |
| `daily-cache.json` | `src/daily-cache.ts` | Tracks `lastComputedDate`; new days are backfilled, old days are reused. |

All three use atomic write (temp file + `rename`) and write with mode `0o600`. All three carry a numeric `version` field; bumping it forces a recompute next run.

The session cache (`src/session-cache.ts`) sits beside them as a directory of per-provider-month shards. A date-ranged query reads only the shards whose months can contribute a turn to that range; `CODEBURN_CACHE_SCOPE=all` turns that off and reads every shard, whatever the range. It is a read policy only — it is not part of any provider's env fingerprint, so setting or unsetting it never invalidates the cache.

### Optimize Detectors

`src/optimize.ts` exports 20 detectors. Each returns a `WasteFinding | null`. They are composed by `runOptimize()` which collects findings, ranks them by impact, and returns them with `WasteAction` objects (paste-to-CLAUDE.md, paste-to-session-opener, prompt-now, edit shell config).

| Detector | Line | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| `detectJunkReads` | 428 | Reads into `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, etc. |
| `detectDuplicateReads` | 477 | Re-reads of the same file in a session. |
| `detectMcpToolCoverage` | 795 | MCP servers with many tools but low usage. |
| `detectUnusedMcp` | 855 | MCP servers configured but never invoked. |
| `detectBloatedClaudeMd` | 944 | `CLAUDE.md` files past a healthy size. |
| `detectLowReadEditRatio` | 987 | Edit-heavy sessions with too few prior reads. |
| `detectCacheBloat` | 1048 | High `cache_creation_input_tokens`. |
| `detectGhostAgents` | 1124 | Defined but never-invoked Claude agents. |
| `detectGhostSkills` | 1154 | Defined but never-invoked skills. |
| `detectGhostCommands` | 1184 | Defined but never-invoked slash commands. |
| `detectBashBloat` | 1228 | Shell output limit set above the recommended 15K chars. |
| `detectLowWorthSessions` | 1405 | Sessions with cost but no edits or git delivery. |
| `detectContextBloat` | 1512 | Input:output token ratio above 25:1. |
| `detectSessionOutliers` | 1558 | Sessions costing more than 2x the project average. |

### Output Formats

| Command | `--format` choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `report`, `today`, `month` | `tui`, `json` | `tui` |
| `status` | `terminal`, `menubar-json`, `json` | `terminal` |
| `export` | `csv`, `json` | `csv` |
| `plan` | `text`, `json` | `text` |

The macOS menubar and GNOME extension consume `menubar-json`. `src/menubar-json.ts` defines the contract; `tests/menubar-json.test.ts` pins it.

## Providers (`src/providers/`)

Every provider implements the `Provider` interface in `src/providers/types.ts`:

```ts
type Provider = {
  name: string
  displayName: string
  modelDisplayName(model: string): string
  toolDisplayName(rawTool: string): string
  discoverSessions(): Promise<SessionSource[]>
  createSessionParser(source: SessionSource, seenKeys: Set<string>): SessionParser
}
```

`src/providers/index.ts` registers providers across two tiers:

- **Eager**: `claude`, `cline`, `cline-cli`, `codewhale`, `codebuff`, `codex`, `copilot`, `devin`, `droid`, `dsh`, `gemini`, `hermes`, `ibm-bob`, `kilo-code`, `kiro`, `kimi`, `kimicode`, `lingtai-tui`, `mistral-vibe`, `mux`, `openclaw`, `openclaude`, `open-design`, `pi`, `omp`, `qwen`, `quickdesk`, `zerostack`, `grok`, `grokbot`, `amp`, `command-code`. Imported at module load.
- **Lazy**: `antigravity`, `forge`, `goose`, `cursor`, `opencode`, `cursor-agent`, `crush`, `warp`, `vercel-gateway`, `zcode`, `zed`. Imported via dynamic `import()` so the heavy dependencies (SQLite, protobuf, network clients) do not touch users who do not have those tools installed.

Both lists hit the same `getAllProviders()` aggregator. A failed lazy import is silent and excludes that provider from the run.

### WSL roots (Windows)

`src/wsl.ts` is inert off Windows: `wslHomes()` returns `[]` and nothing is spawned. On Windows it runs `%SystemRoot%\System32\wsl.exe --list --quiet --running` (3 s timeout, absolute path so nothing dropped next to the CLI can impersonate it), decodes its UTF-16LE output, keeps only lines shaped like a distro name (single token, no path-banned characters, no trailing period — which discards the "no installed distributions" prose wholesale), drops container-runtime distros, and enumerates `\\wsl$\<distro>\home\*` plus `\\wsl$\<distro>\root`. `\\wsl$\` is probed before `\\wsl.localhost\`: the older spelling works on every build, while probing `wsl.localhost` on a build that lacks it stalls through MUP, SMB and DNS. Results have a 60-second, mode-aware TTL; changing `running`, `all`, or `off` takes effect immediately, and an orphan reconciliation re-probes before deciding whether a missing source is offline or deleted.

`claude` (via `getClaudeConfigDirs`) and `codex` (via `createCodexProvider`) append `<wslHome>/.claude` and `<wslHome>/.codex` to their root lists, so the existing multi-root discovery, `probeRoots()` and `codeburn doctor` cover them with no other changes. Roots are additive — they do not replace `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIRS`/`CODEX_HOME`.

Two knock-on rules:

- **Running distros only** by default. Touching `\\wsl$\<distro>` boots a stopped distro, which is intrusive and slow. `CODEBURN_WSL=all` opts into every installed distro; `CODEBURN_WSL=off` disables both discovery and UNC access while retained historical cache rows remain reportable. It is a read policy, never part of a cache fingerprint (see `PROVIDER_ENV_VARS` in `src/session-cache.ts`).
- **Fingerprints drop `dev`/`ino` for `\\wsl$` paths** (`fingerprintFile` in `src/session-cache.ts` and `src/codex-cache.ts`). The 9P share synthesizes them per mount, so keying on them would re-parse every WSL session on every run; mtime+size alone still detects both a modification and an append.
- **Offline and deleted are reconciled separately.** A stopped distro drops its whole root out of discovery, so cached WSL rows remain reportable without statting the unavailable UNC share. When the owning home is still reachable, an undiscovered transcript is a real deletion and is evicted like a native source, including from Codex's separate raw-result cache. Claude rows carrying PR links retain the pre-existing historical-attribution exception. This also works when WSL was the provider's only source; the generic orphan pass still runs for cached WSL rows even with zero newly discovered files.

Session `cwd` values recorded inside WSL are Linux paths (`/home/me/proj`) that name nothing on the Windows filesystem. `resolveCanonicalProjectPath` (`src/parser.ts`) already refuses to walk a path that is not absolute *on the current platform*, so those are attributed to the recorded `cwd` verbatim instead of being walked or canonicalized.

`src/providers/vscode-cline-parser.ts` is a shared helper consumed by `cline`, `ibm-bob`, and `kilo-code`. It is not registered as a provider on its own.

For the per-provider data location, storage format, parser quirks, and test coverage, see `docs/providers/`.

### Model rows and billing routes (`src/models.ts`)

Every report keys a model row on `modelRowKey(model, route)`, never on the raw id and never on `getShortModelName` directly. The key is the model's short name plus, when the call was billed through a door other than the vendor's own API, the door's label: `Haiku 4.5`, `Haiku 4.5 (Bedrock)`, `Haiku 4.5 (Bedrock us)`, `north-mini-code:free (OpenRouter)`. One SKU through one door is one row; the same key is used by `parser.ts` (`modelBreakdown`), `day-aggregator.ts` (`day.models`, since daily cache v33), `usage-aggregator.ts`, `menubar-json.ts`, `model-breakdown.ts`, `models-report.ts` and every renderer, so the surfaces cannot disagree about what one row is. `models-report.ts` folds on the alias-resolved id plus that same row-key suffix, never on the route id, so two doors sharing one label land on one row instead of two the reader cannot tell apart. The key is idempotent: a pre-v33 daily row keyed by display name re-keys to itself. One surface is deliberately outside this: the desktop Trend timeline (`granular-history.ts`) still keys on the raw model id.

A **route** is the door, and it has two sources feeding one `route` field on the call (`ParsedProviderCall` → `ParsedApiCall` → `CachedCall`):

- the model id, when the door renames the model. `getModelRoute(id)` recognises Bedrock's `<vendor>.<model>[-vN:M]` with an optional cross-region profile prefix (`us.`, `eu.`, `global.`, …) for the vendors with coding sessions on disk (`anthropic`, `openai`). The profile is a dearer SKU and stays a distinct row (the `(Bedrock us)` variant).
- the provider's own endpoint field, when it does not. `routeFromProviderField(value)` maps Hermes' `billing_provider` and OpenCode's `providerID`: `bedrock`, exact `amazon-bedrock`, exact `openrouter`, and exact `google-vertex` / `google-vertex-anthropic` become registered routes; direct doors (`anthropic`, `openai`, …) map to nothing, because the unsuffixed row *is* the direct row. Only doors with usage-bearing sessions on disk are registered, the same rule the id shapes follow.

A call can also carry an optional **billing mode**: `metered` for a provider-recorded actual charge or a registered metered route, and `subscription` only when the provider records that the usage was included. Absence stays unknown; neither provider name, model name, calculated cost, nor plan ownership fills it. `models`, `sessions`, `export`, and `audit` expose call-level `--route` and `--billing` filters. `--route direct` is the complement of registered routes and therefore includes unknown doors. Filtered work-unit grouping is rejected rather than inferring a missing root; durable `today`/`status` and payload filtering wait for a cache schema that preserves this dimension.

Pricing never consults the route or billing mode. `getModelCosts` runs on the raw id, and LiteLLM already carries the routed rows, so selection and grouping never change what a call costs.

## macOS Menubar (`mac/`)

Swift package (`mac/Package.swift`), targets macOS 14, strict concurrency on. Layout under `mac/Sources/CodeBurnMenubar/`:

- `CodeBurnApp.swift` boots the SwiftUI `App` and the `NSStatusItem`.
- `AppStore.swift` is the single source of truth for UI state.
- `Data/` holds models, the CLI client, credential stores, and subscription services.
  - `DataClient.swift` spawns the CLI and decodes `MenubarPayload`. See file-level comment for why we never route through `/bin/zsh -c`.
  - `MenubarPayload.swift` mirrors the JSON the CLI emits; keep it in sync with `src/menubar-json.ts`.
- `Security/CodeburnCLI.swift` resolves the CLI binary (env override `CODEBURN_BIN`, fallback `codeburn`), validates each argv entry against an allowlist regex, and augments PATH for Homebrew and npm-global installs. The Process is launched via `/usr/bin/env`, never via a shell.
- `Theme/` holds color and typography constants and the dark/light state.
- `Views/` are the SwiftUI components rendered inside `NSPopover`.

Tests live in `mac/Tests/CodeBurnMenubarTests/` (currently `CapacityEstimatorTests.swift`).

The build artifact is a zipped `.app` bundle produced by `mac/Scripts/package-app.sh`. See `RELEASING.md` for how the GitHub Actions workflow uses it.

## Windows Menubar (`windows/`)

Tauri 2 app: a Rust binary (`windows/src-tauri/`) owning the tray and the process spawning, plus a React + TypeScript popover (`windows/src/`) rendered in a WebView2 window. Design tokens come from `windows/tokens.json`, the same file `mac/` reads at build time, so both products render as one.

- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` builds the tray, positions the popover against the taskbar edge, and registers the `#[tauri::command]` surface the frontend calls.
- `src-tauri/src/cli.rs` resolves and spawns the CLI. Only absolute `PATH` directories are searched (an empty entry from `;;` would otherwise resolve against the current directory), `CODEBURN_BIN` is allowlisted, and Windows system tools are spawned by absolute `%SystemRoot%\System32` path because `CreateProcess` searches the current directory first. `MIN_CLI_VERSION` gates the whole app; below it the popover shows a setup screen.
- `src-tauri/src/plan.rs` ports the Claude quota view. Like the macOS `ClaudeCredentialStore`, it never spends Claude's single-use refresh token; on a 401 it re-reads Claude's own credential file for a token Claude Code has already rotated.
- `src-tauri/src/tray_badge.rs` renders today's spend into a second tray icon, since Windows has no menubar title.
- `src/App.tsx` owns the payload cache, the CLI gate, and the refresh cadence, which follows popover visibility the way `mac/`'s `RefreshCadence.swift` does.

`cargo test` covers the PATH filter and the version gate. `windows/DEVELOPMENT.md` has the build, security, and release details; CI is `.github/workflows/windows-menubar-ci.yml` and releases go out on `windows-v*` tags.

The Linux (ksni) paths in the same crate are kept compiling but are experimental and unreleased; `gnome/` is the shipping Linux surface.

## GNOME Extension (`gnome/`)

Plain JavaScript, no bundler. Targets GNOME Shell 45-50 (`metadata.json`).

- `extension.js` is the entry point. On `enable()` it constructs a `CodeBurnIndicator` and adds it to the panel.
- `indicator.js` is the popover. It owns the period selector, the insight tabs, and the provider filter.
- `dataClient.js` wraps `Gio.Subprocess` to call the CLI. It validates argv against the same allowlist pattern as the macOS client and augments PATH with `~/.local/bin`, `~/.npm-global/bin`, `~/.volta/bin`, `~/.bun/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.asdf/shims`, and a few others. Results are cached for 300 seconds.
- `prefs.js` is the settings dialog backed by `schemas/org.gnome.shell.extensions.codeburn.gschema.xml`.
- `install.sh` copies the extension into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`.

## Build (`scripts/`, `tsup.config.ts`)

`npm run build` is two steps:

1. `node scripts/bundle-litellm.mjs` fetches the latest litellm pricing JSON and writes `src/data/litellm-snapshot.json`. The bundle script keeps a manual override for MiniMax variants. Direct (un-prefixed) entries win over prefixed ones. The result is checked in so the build is reproducible.
2. `tsup` reads `tsup.config.ts` and emits a single ESM bundle at `dist/cli.js` with a Node shebang banner. No source maps in publish builds; sourcemaps on for development.

The `prepublishOnly` hook in `package.json` runs `npm run build` so `npm publish` always ships fresh code.

## Tests

`npm test` runs vitest, scoped to `tests/`. 266 test files live there:

- `tests/` root (209 files) covers CLI, parser, optimize, cache, format, models, plans.
- `tests/security/` (1 file) covers prototype-pollution guards.
- `tests/providers/` (49 files) covers per-provider parsing.
- `tests/sharing/` (7 files) covers the share/export surface.
- `tests/setup/` holds the env-isolation setup file, not specs.
- `tests/fixtures/` holds redacted real-world session data.

The scope is deliberate: the Electron app under `app/` has its own vitest config and its
own `jsdom` dependency, so vitest's default glob must not reach it from a root install.
The four `cache-refresh-lock` suites are excluded from `npm test` and run serially via
`npm run test:locks`, because they exercise a cross-process file lock and fail under full
worker pressure.

Three providers ship without dedicated test files today: `claude`, `goose`, `qwen`. Closing this gap is a standing good-first-issue.

CI runs Semgrep against `.semgrep/rules/no-bracket-assign-hot-paths.yml` over `src/providers/` and `src/parser.ts` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). The vitest suite runs in CI too, via `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, on every pull request and every push to `main`.
