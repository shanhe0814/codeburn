//! Is there a newer tray app, is there a newer CLI, and where the reader gets it.
//!
//! Port of `mac/Sources/CodeBurnMenubar/Data/UpdateChecker.swift`, with the Windows release
//! line in place of the mac one: the app ships as an `.msi` under a `windows-v*` tag rather
//! than a zip under `mac-v*`. The check is the same on every route. The install is not.
//!
//! A signature is required before anything installs in one click. The MSI's `.sha256` sits in
//! the same GitHub release, so it proves nothing about who built the file: whoever can replace
//! the one replaces the other. The updater's minisign signature does: the private key lives in
//! CI secrets, never in a release, and the public key is compiled into this binary. So on
//! Windows, once tauri.conf.json carries a real `plugins.updater.pubkey`, an available update
//! gets one button: `download` fetches the MSI that `update-feeds/windows-latest.json` names
//! and refuses it unless the signature verifies, and `install` runs it. Without the key, and on
//! Linux, an available update is answered with a release page and a command to run by hand.
//!
//! Inside a Store package nothing is offered at all: the Store owns the update, and an .msi
//! install underneath it would be undone by the next one.
//!
//! The check runs here rather than in the page for two reasons: the answer has to survive a
//! popover that is closed most of the time, and the webview's CSP has no business reaching
//! api.github.com when the fetch can be made from a place that already talks HTTPS.
