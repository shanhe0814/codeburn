// Translation catalogs, merged from per-section modules in ./catalogs.
//
// `en` is the source of truth. Each section module (settings, overview, …)
// carries its own keys for all six locales; this file flattens them into the
// six records translate() reads. A missing key falls through to `en`, so an
// untranslated string renders English, never a raw identifier.
//
// Keys are dotted and grouped by section (e.g. settings.theme.label). To add a
// section, create ./catalogs/<name>.ts exporting a SectionCatalog and list it in
// SECTIONS below. catalog.test.ts asserts every en key exists in all five others.
